## What this is

DeepSeek Harness (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`) is DeepSeek's official agent harness — think Claude Code.
It targets glibc Linux, so running it on Android means hitting a wall of problems: native
modules that won't compile, `link(2)` blocked by SELinux, a sandbox that won't start,
a frontend laid out for desktops.

**DSHA packages all of that into one APK.** Install, paste your API key, press start —
no Termux, no root, not a single command. Inside is a complete Ubuntu 24.04 environment:
`apt` works, interactive PTYs work, native modules that need a compiler install fine.
It's the same thing you'd run on a server.

---

## Why DSHA

|  | |
|---|---|
| 🚫 **No terminal required** | The offline Ubuntu rootfs ships inside the APK. Nothing to install, configure, or type |
| 🐧 **A real glibc environment** | Not a trimmed-down one: `apt`, PTY, native modules, Python, git all present. Upstream plugins run unmodified |
| ⚡ **proroot: zero ptrace overhead** | Classic proot costs two context switches per syscall; proroot does in-process path translation via LD_PRELOAD + binary patching. Measured **+58%** across key operations on real hardware |
| 🔌 **ADB without Shizuku** | Wireless pairing and keep-alive are built in, so the agent can actually drive the phone — tap, screenshot, install apps |
| 💾 **Survives uninstall** | Conversations and settings live in `Documents/dshdata`, visible and backup-able from any file manager; the API key is encrypted with the Android Keystore |
| 🩺 **Tells you what broke** | 23 self-checks with one-tap repair, 15 self-healing scripts, and when the web UI won't start it names the plugin responsible |

---

## Get running in 30 seconds

1. Grab the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/qiannianhuanxiang/DSHA/releases/latest) (arm64 only)
2. First launch unpacks the bundled environment (a few minutes, once)
3. Paste your DeepSeek API key on the **Config** page → press start on the **Launch** page → the Web UI opens itself

That's it. If you'd rather see every step, use the step-by-step installer — each stage can be
reinstalled or updated on its own.

---

## What's in the box

DSHA isn't just "it boots". Everything below is implemented and shipping.

<details open>
<summary><b>① Environment &amp; installation</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Bundled offline rootfs | Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 inside the APK — full deployment works with no network |
| Step-by-step installer | rootfs / base tools / Node.js / harness as four independent stages, individually reinstallable, nothing downloaded twice |
| Parallel mirror benchmarking | Tsinghua, Aliyun, Huawei, Tencent, NJU, HIT, npmmirror… benchmarked in parallel, you pick from the results |
| Two install paths | Prebuilt package or from source; the source path handles native module builds (node-pty and friends) automatically |
| Verified as it goes | Every stage validates its own output — a half-finished install never reports success |
| Resumable | Fail or quit midway and you continue from that stage, not from scratch |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>② Runtime &amp; performance</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| proroot / proot | proroot by default (no ptrace overhead), switchable back to proot from Config |
| Measured gains | vivo V2352A / Android 14: +58% overall on key operations, +94% on tar (that's what backups use), +82% on stat-heavy work (node module resolution) |
| Three fallbacks | Missing runtime files → silently back to proot; three consecutive boot failures → forced switch with an explanation; installation always uses proot |
| Node.js 24 + pnpm | Same runtime as upstream |
| Foreground service | Status visible in the notification shade; Android won't quietly reap it |
| Watchdog | If the web process dies it comes back on its own |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>③ Data safety &amp; migration</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Uninstall-proof data | Sessions / settings / attachments live in `Documents/dshdata`, with private symlinks left in place |
| Encrypted API key | Android Keystore (AES/CBC), key never leaves the Keystore; the copy inside backups is encrypted too |
| Full backups | Manual backups rotate through 10 slots; automatic backups **alternate between two slots**, so a complete previous copy always survives |
| Backups explain themselves | Each archive carries `DSHA-README.txt`: what's inside, how to pull data out by hand, what won't survive a device change |
| Pre-restore inspection | The whole archive is read once, read-only — gzip's CRC catches truncation and corruption — and you're told how many sessions, how large, from which version |
| Very forgiving restore | Old backups are always accepted; missing plugins reinstall in the background; `link:` paths are rewritten across devices; local-path plugin sources are inlined into the archive |
| Post-restore migration | Version adaptation runs automatically (retire replaced built-in plugins, restore current ones) and the bridge token is realigned |
| Credentials excluded | The machine's bridge token is kept out of backups — archives land in a public directory and shouldn't carry this device's credentials |
| Corrupt session quarantine | Broken session files move to `corrupt-backup`, retrievable any time, so one bad file can't hold the whole UI hostage |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>④ Device control (let the agent actually use the phone)</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Wireless ADB, built in | Pairing and keep-alive included — **Shizuku not required**. The agent can tap, swipe, screenshot, install apps, read logs |
| Shizuku channel | Kept as an alternative path for users who already have it |
| App bridge (127.0.0.1:3090) | The agent can post system notifications, read device info, and ask you for confirmation |
| Dangerous-command gate | Commands that overwrite critical paths or delete recursively get held for approval, over **three channels** — notification, in-app dialog, or the floating bar |
| Streaming floating bar | Model output scrolls across the top of the screen like song lyrics; shows the actual command being run, reasoning optional; background colour, opacity, line count and dwell time all adjustable, with a preview |
| Built-in terminal | Drop straight into the Ubuntu shell — `apt install` whatever you need |
| Root-free file access | The MT Manager file provider is injected, so you can browse and edit the app's private directory from a file manager |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑤ Reliability: it tells you what broke</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| 23 self-checks + one-tap repair | Bridge, ADB, plugins, sessions, backups, runtime, public data, guard patches, web auth… each inspected, and whatever can be fixed is fixed on the spot |
| Plain-language plugin diagnosis | When the web UI won't start you get "it's plugin X, the service it wants doesn't exist, tap here to fix" — not a screen of Node stack traces |
| 15 self-healing &amp; patch scripts | pnpm shell restoration, bundle resolution repair, profile boot repair, `.l2s` chain flattening, session repair, dependency repair, filesystem write patches… |
| Signed incremental updates | Key scripts update from GitHub with **offline signature verification** (public key embedded; a bad signature rejects the whole batch), so fixes don't wait for a new APK |
| Failures written to disk | Backup, install and boot failures record their reason to a file that the self-check reads — "nothing happened" never stays unexplainable |
| CI gatekeepers | Every push runs Fast checks: manifest consistency, offline signature verification, 300 pure-logic assertions, and real compilation of every asset script. Releases abort outright on a certificate fingerprint mismatch |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑥ Network &amp; access</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Embedded WebView | GeckoView, so you're not at the mercy of the system WebView version |
| LAN access | Keep dsh on the phone, use it from a laptop or tablet browser. Token auth is fail-closed and sets a `SameSite=Strict` cookie on first hit so the token can't leak through outbound links |
| One-tap addresses | Copy the local or LAN URL (token included) from the launch page; refreshed by heartbeat |
| Old-browser polyfills | `AbortSignal.any/timeout` and `crypto.randomUUID` are injected automatically — the latter is mandatory over LAN HTTP, which is not a secure context |
| Configurable port | Set the web port yourself; conflicts fall back with an explanation |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑦ Plugin ecosystem</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Plugin marketplace | Browse, install, update, enable/disable, remove — all in-app |
| Mobile UI adaptation built in | Ships [dsh-web-mobile](https://github.com/mexiaosqwq/dsh-web-mobile) (MIT): single column on narrow screens, directory as a drawer, settings as a bottom sheet, status-bar safe area, readable tables and bubbles |
| Device skill guide built in | Tells the agent which device capabilities are available here |
| Hard dependencies rewritten | Plugins that hard-require a service get rewritten to runtime injection — one plugin should not take the whole plugin tree down with it |
| Built-ins protected | Built-in plugins can't be deleted by accident, and ones you disabled stay disabled across upgrades |
| Import / export | Plugin configuration can be exported and restored |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑧ For developers &amp; agents</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Entry document for AI and new contributors: structure, contracts, known traps — skip the full-repo scan |
| Agent skills | [`agent-skills/`](agent-skills/) ships `device-shell` (ADB / Shizuku bridge) and `screen-ocr-operator` (OCR + batched screen actions) |
| Pure-logic test suite | 300 assertions with no Android dependency; `bash tools/pure-logic-test.sh` finishes in seconds |
| Activity log | Key actions and failure reasons are recorded, so bug reports have something to stand on |
| Build entirely in CI | No computer needed: push a tag and a signed APK comes out, with an arm64 runner building the rootfs |

</details>

## How this compares

There are two ways to run dsh on Android. Both pay for something, and saying so is more
useful than trading labels:

| | **Container approach** (DSHA) | **Termux bootstrap approach** |
|---|---|---|
| Method | proot/proroot + full glibc rootfs | Termux packages running natively on Android bionic |
| Setup | Install an APK | Install Termux → type commands → install a toolchain |
| Environment | Complete Ubuntu; `apt` and native modules just work | Every native module needs a bionic patch or rebuild |
| Overhead | proroot has no ptrace cost | No container layer at all, theoretically fastest |
| Sandbox | Available | bubblewrap blocked by sepolicy, degrades |

Credit where it's due: the Termux side has come a long way.
[deepseek-harness-termux](https://github.com/Vengisk/deepseek-harness-termux) compiles node-pty
with exact upstream patches and swaps `link(2)` for `rename(2)` to get around SELinux;
[deepseek-harness-android](https://github.com/FunnelCakes/deepseek-harness-android) keeps a
genuinely useful compatibility matrix. "Termux builds are feature-crippled" is an outdated claim.

**DSHA's difference isn't that they can't run it.** It's that setup needs no command line,
the environment is real glibc rather than patches holding bionic together, and the app layer
brings things a script can't: direct ADB, the floating bar, the backup/restore system,
self-checks and self-healing, the plugin marketplace.

## Known limits

Listed up front so you don't discover them after installing:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | ⚠️ arm64-v8a only | No 32-bit or x86 devices |
| OS | ✅ Android 8.0+ | Older versions untested |
| Download size | ⚠️ ~370 MB | The price of bundling a full Ubuntu — and what buys you the zero-setup install |
| bash sandbox | ⚠️ Unavailable | Android sepolicy blocks bubblewrap, so dsh runs with `danger-full-access`. Judge the risk yourself |
| Zhuoyitong / HarmonyOS anco | ❓ Unverified | Should work in theory, no device regression yet |
| Floating bar | ⚠️ Needs permission | Drawn with `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`; the real status-bar ticker API isn't reachable without root |
| Data location | ⚠️ Needs file permission | If "All files access" is denied, data stays private and dies with uninstall (the self-check states which case you're in) |

👉 For **what each permission actually exposes and what the agent can reach on your phone**, see the [security model](docs/security-model.en.md) — including the weaknesses we list ourselves.

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────── APK ────────────────────────┐
│ Native Android (Java 17) · Material3 · GeckoView    │
│  ├ Launch / Install / Config / Workspace / Plugins  │
│  │   / Terminal / Settings                          │
│  ├ Foreground service + watchdog + notifications    │
│  ├ App bridge :3090    LAN bridge :3081             │
│  └ Floating bar (TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ proroot (default, no ptrace cost) / proot (fallback) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 · Node.js 24 · pnpm              │
│  └ @deepseek-ai/dsh  →  Web UI :3080                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Data: sessions / settings / attachments in `Documents/dshdata` (visible, backup-able).
`DSH_HOME` itself and `.credentials.yaml` deliberately stay private.

---

## Wireless ADB pairing (device shell)

Once paired, the agent can drive this phone directly — **no Shizuku needed**.

**First time (about a minute)**

1. Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" seven times to unlock developer options
2. Developer options → enable **Wireless debugging**
3. Open Wireless debugging → "Pair device with pairing code" → note the **IP:port** and the **6-digit code**
4. Back in DSHA → **Workspace** page → ADB section → enter both → pair

**After that** DSHA maintains the connection itself (keep-alive plus reconnect) and recovers
after a reboot. Nothing more to do.

**Verify**: run `adb shell id` in the built-in terminal; `uid=2000(shell)` means you're set.

**Give it to your agent**: copy the skills into your agent's skill directory:

```bash
cp -r agent-skills/device-shell ~/.agents/skills/
cp -r agent-skills/screen-ocr-operator ~/.agents/skills/
```

---

## Building

**In CI (recommended — no computer required)**

```bash
git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3   # triggers the release pipeline, signed APK comes out
```

Two stages: `ubuntu-24.04-arm` builds the rootfs natively on arm64 (cached), then
`ubuntu-latest` packs it into the APK and verifies the certificate fingerprint.
Pushing to `main` also runs a debug build plus Fast checks.

**Locally** (Gradle 8.5 + Android SDK + JDK 17)

```bash
./build.sh                      # needs app/src/main/assets/offline-rootfs.tar.gz first
bash tools/pure-logic-test.sh   # 300 pure-logic assertions, no device needed
```
