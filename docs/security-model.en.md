# DSHA Security Model — what it can reach on your phone

You installed a 370 MB APK that lets an AI run shell commands on your device, and you may
have handed it ADB access on top of that. This document states **where the boundaries are**:
what the agent can reach, what it cannot, what needs your explicit approval, and what each
permission actually exposes once granted.

If a line doesn't make sense to you, treat it as dangerous. You can run DSHA in its most
restricted configuration — no ADB, no file permission, no LAN access — and dsh still works fine.

## In one sentence

**By default the agent can only touch DSHA's own private directory.** Every step beyond that
is opt-in, granted explicitly by you, and individually revocable.

---

## What the agent reaches by default

Fresh install, no permissions granted:

| Scope | Reachable | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The Ubuntu container | ✅ Fully | This is its workspace. `apt install`, compiling, running services — all here |
| DSHA's private directory | ✅ Read/write | The rootfs lives here (`/data/data/com.dsh.client/`); Android's app sandbox keeps everyone else out |
| Shared storage (`/sdcard`) | ✅ Read/write | `/sdcard` inside the container maps to shared storage. **This is on by default** — photos, downloads, documents are all readable |
| Other apps' data | ❌ No | Android app sandbox isolation; `/data/data/<other.package>` is unreachable |
| System partition | ❌ Not writable | Without root, `/system` cannot be modified |
| Dialer, SMS, contacts, location, camera, microphone | ❌ No | DSHA never requests these permissions — verify it yourself in system settings |

> ⚠️ **`/sdcard` is reachable by default** and this is the easiest one to overlook. If you don't
> want the agent seeing your gallery and downloads, right now your options are convention
> (tell it so in `AGENTS.md`) or not keeping sensitive files on this phone.
> Mount points live in `ContainerRuntime.BINDS` if you build it yourself.

## Capabilities that need your approval

Each one is **off by default**, toggled in-app, revocable at any time.

### Wireless ADB (Workspace page)

**What granting it means**: the agent gets `shell` user privileges (uid 2000). It can tap,
swipe, take screenshots, install and uninstall apps, read system logs, list installed
packages, and change some system settings. **This is the second most powerful thing this
project can hand out**, behind only root.

- The pairing code is used once; a keypair maintains the connection afterwards. DSHA never stores your pairing code
- To revoke: turn off Wireless debugging in system settings, or revoke all debugging authorizations
- What ADB cannot do: read other apps' private data, or obtain root

### Root shell (Config page, off by default)

**What granting it means**: everything. With root there are no boundaries left to discuss.

- Requires a rooted device (KernelSU / Magisk). DSHA neither provides nor requests root
- The flag is `allow_root_shell`, default false
- Don't enable it unless you know exactly why you are

### "All files access" (prompted on first launch)

**What granting it means**: DSHA can read and write all of shared storage. It uses this to
move conversation data into `Documents/dshdata`, which is what makes **data survive uninstall**.

- If you decline: data stays in the private directory and **dies with uninstall** (the self-check tells you which state you're in)
- It grants the agent no new reach — `/sdcard` was already available

### Overlay window (the streaming floating bar, off by default)

**What granting it means**: DSHA can draw on top of other apps.

- It's used only to display model output and the approval buttons for dangerous commands. It does not read or capture the screen
- Content appears on your screen — **anyone nearby can read it**, which is why it ships disabled

### LAN access (off by default)

**What enabling it means**: devices on the same Wi-Fi can reach the dsh Web UI on your phone.

- Token authentication is **fail-closed**: a missing or wrong token is always rejected; there is no "empty token means allow" path
- On first successful hit the token becomes a `SameSite=Strict` cookie and disappears from the URL — so it can't leak through outbound links
- Don't enable it on public Wi-Fi. The token is strong, but you're exposing a port on the network

## What happens when the agent tries something dangerous

`dsh-guard.sh` intercepts these and hands the decision to you:

- Overwriting or deleting critical paths (`/`, `/root`, `/etc`, `/data`, …)
- Recursive deletion (`rm -rf`)
- Writing directly to block devices, modifying partitions
- Uninstalling apps or factory-reset-class operations over ADB

Once intercepted, approve through **any of three channels**: the notification, the in-app
dialog, or the button on the floating bar. All three share one decision — first tap wins —
and 60 seconds of silence counts as a refusal.

> ⚠️ **The gate is not a sandbox.** It's a denylist over command text, and it isn't hard to
> get around — it defends against an AI slipping, not against someone deliberately writing a
> command that evades it. Android has no bubblewrap, so dsh runs with `danger-full-access`.
> There is exactly one real isolation boundary: **the Android app sandbox**.

## Where your keys and data live

| Item | Location | Protection |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek API key | App SharedPreferences | Android Keystore encryption (AES/CBC). **The key never leaves the Keystore**; other apps cannot read it |
| API key inside backups | `.dsh/.dsha-apikey` in the archive | Same Keystore key. **Undecryptable after a device change** — by design, not a bug. You can turn off "include key in backup" in Config |
| Conversations | `Documents/dshdata` (public) or private dir | ⚠️ In the public location, **any app with storage permission can read them**. That's the price of surviving uninstall |
| Backup archives | `Download/DSHA/` | ⚠️ Public directory, and they contain **all** your conversations. Think before sharing one |
| dsh's own credentials | `.dsh/.credentials.yaml` | Deliberately kept private, never migrated to the public area — but it **does go into backups** |
| Bridge token (:3090) | `.dsh/.bridge_token` | Private directory, mode 600. **Excluded from backups** — it belongs to this machine |

**We collect nothing.** No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting. The only outbound
requests are: GitHub API when you tap check-for-updates, raw.githubusercontent.com when
scripts hot-update, and whichever mirror you picked during installation. API calls go from
dsh straight to DeepSeek and never pass through anything of ours.

## Verifying the APK you installed

Sideloading an APK from GitHub makes provenance the thing most worth checking:

```bash
# 1. Hash — proves the file wasn't altered
sha256sum -c deepseekharness-arm64-vX.Y.Z.apk.sha256

# 2. Build provenance — proves it came from this repo's CI at that tag,
#    not from someone else's repackage
gh attestation verify deepseekharness-arm64-vX.Y.Z.apk --repo qiannianhuanxiang/DSHA
```

The signing certificate fingerprint is verified on every release run, and a mismatch
**aborts the release** — a wrongly signed package can't even be installed over an existing
one (Android only allows same-signature upgrades), so shipping it would be worse than
failing the build.

## Known weaknesses

Not hidden:

| Weakness | Status |
|---|---|
| `danger-full-access` | Android sepolicy blocks bubblewrap, so dsh has no sandbox. The agent has full control inside the container |
| The gate is bypassable | A denylist over command text: guards against slips, not deliberate evasion |
| Backups sit in a public directory | Every conversation, in plaintext, under `Download/DSHA/`, readable by any app with storage permission |
| `.credentials.yaml` goes into backups | dsh's credential file rides along into the public directory; whether to add an exclusion toggle is undecided |
| `/sdcard` reachable by default | The agent can read your gallery and downloads out of the box; there's no toggle yet |
| Signing key needs rotation | Releases are signed with a debug keystore for historical reasons — replacing it would break upgrades for every existing user. Rotation via APK Signature Scheme v3 is scheduled separately |
